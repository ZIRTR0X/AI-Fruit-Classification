# Classification-de-fruits
  
## Description :  
An application school project done in second year (2A/Y2).    
   
Creation of an AI in python, which by giving it an image of a fruit, it will give us the name of this fruit.  
   
University : Université Clermont-Auvergne, Aubière, France.  
District : IUT Informatique.  
## Objective:
To perform a classification of different types of fruits. The machine receives in input images (samples) and must give in output the names of the fruits (labels). Our goal is to have an accuracy of 90% minimum.  

## Results:
Using the SVM model, with 14 fruits with a total of 9288 images, we obtain an accuracy of 92.9 %.

## Dataset:  
We have chosen the "Fruits 360" dataset which contains various images of different types of fruits, taken from different angles and which comes from the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits'>Kaggle</a> website.
All images have been checked and our dataset contains no errors in the images. All data used is relevant, the more data we have the more accurate we will be. We have selected fourteen different fruits with possible variations, for example, we have several "golden apples" but with a different appearance.  
Our dataset is split in two: 3/4 train and 1/4 test.
